# üß† **Feedforward Neural Network for Shape Classification**

MATLAB project developed for the **Knowledge and Reasoning** course at the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra (ISEC).  
The goal is to design, train, and evaluate **feedforward neural networks** capable of classifying geometric shapes from images.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Main Features**

- Image preprocessing (resizing, grayscale conversion, binarization)  
- One-hot encoding for target representation  
- Training and testing of feedforward networks with various topologies  
- Comparative analysis of:
  - Training and activation functions  
  - Data division ratios (train/validation/test)  
  - Model generalization and overfitting  
- Confusion matrix generation and performance visualization  
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive model training and classification

## üñ•Ô∏è **Graphical Application**

An interactive MATLAB GUI allows the user to:
- Configure network parameters (neurons, layers, functions)
- Train or import models
- Load or draw new images
- Classify shapes and visualize results
